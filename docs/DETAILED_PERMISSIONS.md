## Important Notes

1. **Faculty CANNOT Apply**: This is a fundamental design decision. Faculty create opportunities and recruit; they don't apply.

2. **Faculty Limited Browsing**: Faculty only see:
   - Their own posts
   - AI-recommended candidates for their posts
   - They do NOT have a general "Home" feed showing all posts

3. **Temporary Connections Only**: Neither role can build permanent professional networks. Connections exist only during active project collaboration.

4. **AI Recommendations**: Exclusive to faculty to help them find suitable candidates without browsing all profiles manually.

5. **Student Primary Flow**:
   ```
   Browse Posts → Apply → Get Accepted → Join Chatroom → Collaborate
   ```

6. **Faculty Primary Flow**:
   ```
   Create Post → View AI Recommendations → Invite Candidates → Review Applications → Accept → Manage Team
   ```
